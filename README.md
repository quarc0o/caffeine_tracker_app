# Caffeine Tracker App

This project was part of a 24 hour case challenge held by [Computas](https://computas.com). It aims at calculating remaining caffeine contents in the users body, taking into consideration factors like age, weight and a subjective feeling of caffeine sensitivity.

Caffeine metabolism is highly individual, and a lot more factors play a role than the ones taken into consideration here. This project only serves to explore the possibility, and was done mostly for fun ðŸ˜Ž

## Demo

### The homescreen of the app has a graph displaying caffeine contents in the body at different time intervalls and drinks consumed the last 24 hours

### Pressing "add" lets users add a drink (coffe, tea or energy drink) and shows the caffeine contents of each

### In the profile section, the user can add their personal information, to get a more accurate graph

### Holding a finger on the graph lets the user see exact caffeine content at a specific time
